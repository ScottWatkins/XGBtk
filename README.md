# XGBtk
Implementation of the XGBoost libraries in Python and R are well-developed. The Julia programming language is a fast and flexible language well-suited to machine learning applications. Wrappers implementing XGBoost in the Julia language are available but limited in scope. Simplified, automated analysis for evaluating various boosting models and tuning model parameters are highly desirable. To enable greater use of XGBoost and the XGBoost.jl package, we developed a collection of wrappers and downstream analysis functions and implemented them in the XGB-toolkit (XGBtk). This package builds on the XGBoost.jl package. Currently, XGBtk implements mlogloss for multi-class probabilistic classification. Other classifiers will be added in the future. The current package implements XGB version 1.6 and uses XGBoost.jl version 1.5.2. The package builds on the work of the Julia XGBoost.jl team and the Distributed Deep Machine Learning Community.
